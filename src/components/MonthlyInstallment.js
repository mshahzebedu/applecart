          <h3>Select Apple Card<br/> Monthly Installments<br/> when you shop.</h3>
          <p>Whether you shop on apple.com, on the<br/> Apple Store app, or at an Apple Store, simply <r/>choose Apple Card Monthly Installments as<br/> your payment option when you make<br/>your purchase.</p>
          <h3>Easily view your <br/>installments in the <br/>Wallet app.</h3>
          <p>Your monthly installments live alongside<br/> your everyday Apple Card purchases in the<br/> Wallet app. So it’s easy to see your <br/>installments, remaining balance, and <br/>payment history.</p>
          <h3>One balance to track<br/> and pay.</h3>
          <p>Your monthly installment is automatically<br/> added to the minimum payment due on your<br/> Apple Card — including any associated <br/>AppleCare+ coverage. And if you’ve<br/> purchased multiple products, you’ll still only <br/>have one balance to pay.</p>
          <h3>Get Daily Cash you<br/> can use right away.</h3>
          <p>You get 3% Daily Cash back on the<br/> purchase price of your new Apple<br/> product — all up front. It’s deposited to your<br/> Apple Cash card in the Wallet app right <br/>away, and it’s ready to use whenever and<br/> however you want.</p>
